                        <p style="font-size: 1em; margin-top: -30px;">Hello! My name is Jaden Nkwanga-Bryant and I'm a second-year student at Washington State University majoring in Computer Science with an intended minor in Digital Technology & Culture. I moved to Washington State all the way from Augusta, Georgia in Fall of 2019 to start the next chapter of my life at college and I've been in love with it ever since. I wanted to get away from home for a little while, which was a major deciding factor in my decision to attend the school I am at today. I also have family out here who helped to make the transition to life on my own in a new place a lot better!</p>
			<p style="font-size: 1em; margin-top: -30px;">When I'm not sitting in class, completing assignments or working to pay my bills, I enjoy the outdoors and travelling. Additionally, I love the engaging in the world of politics, writing code, reading, catching up on Netflix or everybody's favorite, sleeping!</p>
